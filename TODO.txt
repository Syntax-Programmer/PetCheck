1. A wide range of pets supported.
2. Give breed specific advice
3. Give reminders to food time, walks etc.
5. Track meal plans, diets, and vet appointments.
6. Have a free tier along side a paid one.

One thing I tell you, Accounting for all the pet types in the start is unfealsible. So what we can do is start with a small group of them and add new as the app grows. Also when the company grows please hire vets and stuff to adivce and curate the advices we give
You can reach to real doctors and stuff to factcheck advices I code in, it is not my job and my expertise to fact check every medical advice I pull off the internet.
